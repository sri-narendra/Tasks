🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - TASKS APP

This guide outlines the steps to deploy the Tasks App with a GitHub Pages frontend and a Render backend.

---
1. BACKEND DEPLOYMENT (RENDER)
---
1. Create a Account on Render.com
2. Click "New" > "Blueprint" (since we have a render.yaml).
3. Connect your GitHub repository: https://github.com/sri-narendra/Tasks.git
4. Render will automatically detect the 'render.yaml' file.
5. You will be prompted to fill in the environment variables:
   - MONGODB_URI: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
   - JWT_SECRET: (Render will auto-generate this if left blank).
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Your future GitHub Pages URL (e.g., https://sri-narendra.github.io/Tasks).
6. Click "Apply". Render will start the build (cd backend && npm install) and deploy (node server.js).

---
2. FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT (GITHUB PAGES)
---
1. In your GitHub repository (https://github.com/sri-narendra/Tasks.git), go to "Settings" > "Pages".
2. Under "Build and deployment" > "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
3. Select the 'main' branch and the '/(root)' folder.
4. Click "Save". GitHub will start a build action.
5. Once complete, your site will be live at: https://sri-narendra.github.io/Tasks

---
3. POST-DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION
---
1. Once your Render backend is live (e.g., https://tasksapp-xxxx.onrender.com), copy that URL.
2. Open 'src/config.js' in your code.
3. Update the 'BACKEND_URL' for production to match your Render URL.
4. Commit and push the change to GitHub.
5. GitHub Pages and Render will both auto-redeploy with the correct routing.

---
✅ TROUBLESHOOTING
---
- If the frontend shows a "Network Error", ensure the Render backend is active and the URL starts with https://
- Ensure the Render URL in config.js DOES NOT end with a trailing slash (/) as the api.js adds '/api' automatically.
- Check Render Logs for any "EADDRINUSE" or "MONGODB CONNECTION" errors.
